The query that does not work is SELECT * FROM headfirst.easy_drinks WHERE main = soda;
	This query does not work because there are no quotations around soda

The ones I didn't expect to work were:
	SELECT * FROM headfirst.easy_drinks WHERE main > 'soda';
	#SELECT * FROM headfirst.easy_drinks WHERE main = soda;
	SELECT * FROM headfirst.easy_drinks WHERE amount2 < '1';



Extra:
SELECT CONVERT( directions USING utf8 ) FROM headfirst.easy_drinks WHERE drink_name = "Blackthorn\'s Tavern";
SELECT * FROM headfirst.easy_drinks WHERE amount1 = '1.5';
