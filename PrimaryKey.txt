Primary Key Concepts:

1) You have to specify what column in your table is going to be the primary key when you create the table
2) The primary key is used to uniquely identify each record and therefore the data on the primary key column cannot be repeated
3) A primary key cannot be null
4) Primary keys must be compact and should only contain the information it needs to be unique and nothing extra
5) Primary key values cannot be changed as changing it might cause you to assign it to a record that is not unique and already used

Good primary keys could be:
1) Social Security Number
2) Identification Card 
3) Library Card
4) Driver's License
